A media query in CSS is a technique used to apply different styles or rules to a web page based on the characteristics of the device or browser that is rendering the page. It allows you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and other device capabilities.

The purpose of media queries is to provide a way to target specific devices or device features and apply styles accordingly. This enables you to create layouts and designs that are optimized for different devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Media queries work by evaluating certain conditions or features of the device, such as the screen width, height, resolution, and orientation. If the conditions specified in the media query are met, the associated styles or rules are applied; otherwise, they are ignored.

Here's an example of a media query in CSS:

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Styles applied when the screen width is 600px or less */
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

In this example, the media query targets screens with a maximum width of 600 pixels. When the screen width is 600 pixels or less, the font-size of the body element will be set to 14 pixels.

Media queries are commonly used in responsive web design to create fluid and adaptable layouts. By using media queries, you can optimize the appearance and user experience of your website across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
