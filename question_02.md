In CSS, a media query is defined using the @media rule. Here's the basic syntax for creating a media query:

@media mediaType and (mediaFeature) {
  /* Styles to apply when the media query conditions are met */
}

Let's break down the components of a media query:

   @media: This is the keyword that signals the start of a media query rule.

   mediaType: This specifies the type of media to which the media query applies. It can be one of the following values:

      all: Applies to all media types.

      screen: Applies to screens and devices with a color display.

      print: Applies to printers and print preview.

      speech: Applies to speech synthesizers.

      ...and more. There are various media types available, each targeting a specific output device or media.

   mediaFeature: This defines the condition or feature that the media query evaluates. It can be a wide range of features such as width, height, orientation, resolution, aspect ratio, and more. You can use comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, =) to specify the conditions for the media feature.

   Styles to apply: Inside the media query block, you can define the CSS rules and styles that should be applied when the media query conditions are met.

Here's an example that demonstrates a media query targeting screens with a maximum width of 600 pixels:

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Styles to apply for screens with a maximum width of 600px */
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

In this example, the styles inside the media query block will be applied only when the media type is a screen and the maximum width of the screen is 600 pixels or less. In this case, the background color of the body element will be set to light blue.
